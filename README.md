# KF5008 Programme Design - SOLID & Design Patterns

This repository is an experiment to see how we can better teach Design Patterns
by incrementally improving the design of the Olympics ticketing scenario from
workshop 1.

Each incremental branch of the repository will add and improve the software design.
